# Intro to Data Science in Python
Created by Jahnavi Singh

### Purpose
Assignments and practice problems to learn Python for Data Science projects. This repository does not teach how to code. However, learning can be enhanced by completing these assignments in conjuction with the following Coursera courses:
1. [UMich Introduction to Data Science in Python Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis)
2. [IBM Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization)

### Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Python ([Assignment 1](https://github.com/januusingh/data-science-in-python/tree/master/Assignment1/Assignment1))
2. Introduction to Data Cleaning/ Manipulation ([Assignment 2](https://github.com/januusingh/data-science-in-python/tree/master/Assignment2/Assignment2))
3. Introduction to Data Visualization ([Assignment 3](https://github.com/januusingh/data-science-in-python/tree/master/Assignment3/Assignment3))
