    "We will be introducing the fundamentals of Python through Jupyter notebooks. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is an industry-standard programming language commonly used by students and professionals, because it is relatively easy to learn and has many open-source packages or libraries which enable you to write less but more powerful code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python [packages](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/) are modules or pieces of software that can be easily downloaded from external sites using an external package manager called [pip](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-pip-and-pypi) or [conda](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-python-environments-using-conda-32e9f2779307). You don't need to get into the specifics of those, but we can discuss them later. \n",

    "#### What Is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\"In this case, \"notebook\" or \"notebook documents\" denote documents that contain both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations, ... Because of the mix of code and text elements, these documents are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description, and its results, as well as, they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook App produces these documents.\" - DataCamp\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are also often referred to as interactive Python or \"iPython\" notebooks, because you can visualize Python outputs while also running code at the same time. Read the official Jupyter [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) to better understand the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Can I Use a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "You can run cells by clicking the \"Run\" button in the top menu bar or pressing \"Shift\" and \"Enter\" at the same time on your keyboard. You can run each cell individually, which helps make Jupyter so powerful. You can read this [tutorial](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/jupyter-notebook-for-beginners-7cddae3d5466) for more Essential Keyboard Shortcuts.\n",

    "Press the Disk button in the top left corner to \"Save and Checkpoint your notebook\". This is to ensure that you don't loose any important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: Python scripts are saved with \".py\" extensions (Ex: \"sample.py\"), while Jupyter notebooks are saved with \".ipynb\" extensions (\"Sample.ipynb\"). You don't really need to know the distinction between the two right now."
